Both Address.cbl and Pointer.cbl are COBOL programs that demonstrate the use of pointers to access and manipulate data in memory. They are similar in structure and functionality, with slight differences in naming conventions and formatting.

Explanation of the Application
Address.cbl
Identification Division: Identifies the program as WORK-OFFSET.
Data Division:
Working-Storage Section: Defines a data structure WORK-AREA with four fields (WK-A, WK-B, WK-C, WK-D) and a pointer WK-PTR.
Linkage Section: Defines a structure WORK-DATA with two fields (WORK-A, NEXT-WORK-DATA).
Procedure Division:
Main Procedure:
Displays the initial value of WK-PTR.
Sets WK-PTR to the address of WORK-AREA.
Sets the address of WORK-DATA to WK-PTR.
Displays the contents of WORK-DATA, WK-PTR, WORK-A, and NEXT-WORK-DATA.
Ends the program with GOBACK.
Pointer.cbl
Identification Division: Identifies the program as WORK-WITH-POINTER.
Data Division:
Working-Storage Section: Defines a data structure WORK-AREA with four fields (AREA-A, AREA-B, AREA-C, AREA-D) and a pointer W-POINTER.
Linkage Section: Defines a structure WORK-DATA with two fields (WORK-A, NEXT-WORK-DATA).
Procedure Division:
Main Procedure:
Displays the initial value of W-POINTER.
Sets W-POINTER to the address of WORK-AREA.
Sets the address of WORK-DATA to W-POINTER.
Displays the contents of WORK-DATA, W-POINTER, WORK-A, and NEXT-WORK-DATA.
Ends the program with GOBACK.
Interrelation
Both programs demonstrate how to use pointers to reference and manipulate data structures in memory. They follow the same steps:

Define a data structure in the Working-Storage Section.
Define a pointer.
Set the pointer to the address of the data structure.
Use the pointer to set the address of another data structure in the Linkage Section.
Display the values to show how the pointer references the data.
The main difference between the two programs is the naming of variables and the program ID. The functionality and logic are essentially the same.
